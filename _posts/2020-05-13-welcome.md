The purpose of this site is to support canonical citation of easily browsable images of Greek, Latin and other manuscript material.


Browsable facsimile views let you navigate forward and backward through a codex either page by page, or by bifolio spread (depending on the layout of the manuscript).  You can directly open a page from a visual table of contents with thumbnail images of each manuscript, from a pop-up menu listing each page, or even by manipulating the URL in your browser. By appending subdirectories to the base URL <https://browsable-mss.netlify.app/mss/> corresponding to the namespace, group, version, and object identifier of a URN, you can directly map the URN to its address here. For example, *Iliad* 24 begins on folio 250 recto of the "Townley Homer."  The URN for this page is `urn:cite2:citebl:burney86pages.v1:250r` so on this site you will find it at <https://browsable-mss.netlify.app/mss/citebl/burney86pages/v1/250r/>.

The facsimile files are simple static markdown files that include a URN identifying the page or bifolio spread, and an image linked to the Homer Multitext project's Image Citation Tool so that you can also cite regions of the image easily.  Combining citation of a surface and an image lets you model a codex;  add your own canonically citable diplomatic text and you can model a full diplomatic edition with visual evidence for its supporting artifact.
