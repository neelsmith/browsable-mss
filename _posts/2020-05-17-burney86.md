title:  "The Townley Homer"
---

[This earlier post](https://browsable-mss.netlify.app/2020/05/13/welcome.html) gives you a brief overview of what this site is about.

The site now hosts its first manuscript, the British Library's Burney 86, also known as "Townley Homer."  This is the first facsimile in a planned series of important early manuscripts of the *Iliad* with *scholia* (scholarly annotations) that are being studied by the [Homer Multitext project](http://www.homermultitext.org/).  As the series develops, I'll post more detailed information about the available manuscripts including links to other important sites such as [Princeton University Library's list of digitized Greek manuscripts](https://library.princeton.edu/byzantine/manuscript-title-list), and [Pinakes](https://pinakes.irht.cnrs.fr/).
