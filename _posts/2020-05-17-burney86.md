title:  "The Townley Homer"
---


The first manuscript we're testing on this site is the British Library's Burney 86, the "Townley Homer."  This is the first facsimile in a planned series of important early manuscripts of the *Iliad* with *scholia* (scholarly annotations) that are being studied by the [Homer Multitext project](http://www.homermultitext.org/).


## How was it built?

The public domain images served by the British Library were stitched into pyramidal TIF files using Ryan Baumann's freely available tools.  Static markdown pages for this facsimile edition were generated using [this code libary](https://github.com/cite-architecture/codexFacsimile).
