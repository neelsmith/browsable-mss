## The oldest manuscripts of the *Iliad* with scholia

The [Homer Multitext project](http://www.homermultitext.org/) is currently focusing on manuscripts of the *Iliad* with *scholia*.  The six listed here are the earliest manuscripts with *scholia* (generally dated to the tenth or eleventh century).

The following four manuscripts are laid out by page:


- [British Library, Burney 86](../../citebl/burney86pages/v1/) ("the Townley Homer").  Public domain images provided by the British Library.
- [Florence, Biblioteca Laureniziana, codex 32.2](../../citelaur/laur32pages/v1/).  Documentary images from the Laurentian Library presumed to be in the public domain.
- [Venice, Biblioteca Marciana 454 = 822](../../hmt/msA/v1/) ("the Venetus A").   All images derived from originals ©2007, Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana, Venezia, Italia.
